### Oliver McTammany and Matthew Kersey

## Tanks Game in Unity
### Summary
For Hack a Thing 1, we chose to look at programming a simple game in Unity. Neither of us had done any work with Unity or C\# prior to this experience, and decided to follow a couple of tutorials in order to get acquainted. tanks.unitypackage is the result of following the tutorial for a tank game provided on the Unity website. It is a 2 player game in which users battle eachother in tanks. In addition, we decided to create a modded version, 3rdPerson.unitypackage. This version turns the game into a third person shooter type of game, adding more options for motion as well as greater control over the camera. In the map, there are a number of dummy tanks which act as targets for players.

### Division of Labor
We each followed the tutorial individually in order to gain experience. Oliver worked on the original game from the tutorial, while Matthew worked on the modded version.

### What We Learned
We both got some experience working in Unity as well as coding in C\#. 

### What Didn't Work
3rd Person is not quite as polished, there are certain things that we weren't able to accomplish (such as a game manager, audio mixing, and limiting the motion of the camera). Other than that, nothing.
